我一直在想以怎样的方式来写代码才能拥有漂亮的文档. 这些文档应该是随代码实时更新的,最好还能够做到自动校验.
有一种实现的方法就是将文档与代码紧密地结合起来. 越紧密越好. 
 I made some interesting progress in the
[[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2017/03/19/A-Hy-macro-for-defining-functions-with-docstrings-on-each-argument/][last post]], where I used a macro to let me put argument specific documentation in the same place that the argument is
defined. Here I expand the idea to also provide argument default values, and validation code where the argument is defined
inside the function, in addition to generating docstrings. This post is written in Emacs-lisp, mostly because I am more
familiar with the macro language. The idea should apply to other lisps too. 

Let's consider this prototypical, vanilla function definition, usage, and docstring. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun f1 (arg1 arg2)
    "Add two numbers."
    (+ arg1 arg2))

  ;; usage
  (f1 3 4)
#+END_SRC

Here is what the help looks like from emacs. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (describe-function 'f1)
#+END_SRC

It is clear I was lazy in writing the docstring; it does not even mention the arguments. There is also no validation of the
arguments so if you pass a string and a number, you will get an error. There are no defaults either, so you have to provide
both arguments. It seems like there could be significant room for improvement. Of course, I could bite the bullet and write
a better function like this one: 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun f1a (arg1 &optional arg2)
    "Add ARG1 and ARG2 together.
  ARG1 and  ARG2 should both be numbers."
    (when (null arg2) (setq arg2 2))
    (unless (and (numberp arg1) (numberp arg2)) (error "arg1 and arg2 should both be numbers"))
    (+ arg1 arg2))

  (list (f1a 3 4) (f1a 3))
#+END_SRC

Yes, I could do that, but it is tedious to do it all the time. And it still leaves something to be desired for me. The
docstring does not say what the default value is for example, and that is hard-coded in the code, i.e. not introspectible
until you look at the code. Next we consider an alternative way to write the function. Compare that to this function
definition, usage and documentation. The function definition is a little more verbose. Providing documentation, defaults and
validation code in any form would make it that way no matter what. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defn f2 ((arg1 "A number" :validate numberp)
            (arg2 "A number" :validate numberp :default 2))
    "Add the arguments."
    (+ arg1 arg2))

  ;; usage
  (list (f2 3 4) (f2 3))
  (describe-function 'f2)
#+END_SRC

The documentation is built up from the information in the function definition, in a form that is mostly consistent with
emacs-lisp documentation standards. defn is not a regular emacs-lisp function; it is a macro I developed to generate the
function code. It turned out to be long, but the gist of it is that before defining the function I loop through the
arguments and collect the docstrings, along with any information about default values and/or validation functions. Then I
build up the list of arguments to put in the function. Then if any default values are set, I generate some code to set those
values if they are not set in the function call, and finally a similar block of validation code. At the end, I construct the
defun and return it. You can check out the code if you want here:
[[https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax/blob/master/scimax-macros.el][https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax/blob/master/scimax-macros.el]]. 

Let's take a look at what this code expands to. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (macroexpand-1
   '(defn f2 ((arg1 "A number" :validate numberp)
              (arg2 "A number" :validate numberp :default 2))
      "Add the arguments."
      (+ arg1 arg2)))
#+END_SRC

You can see it expands to a regular defun, with a generated docstring, generated default settings code block, and generated
validation code. Pretty nice. 

Let's see what happens with a function that fails the validation. We should get an error. Here we capture the error so we
can see it in the post. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (condition-case err
      (f2 "oak")
    (error
     (error-message-string err)))
#+END_SRC

So we even get a useful error message when the wrong type of argument is provided. Compare that to the error message from
the original version of this function. It tells us we got the wrong type, but not which argument. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (condition-case err
      (f1 "oak" 4)
    (error
     (error-message-string err)))
#+END_SRC

One last example to check out the &rest argument, with validation that every arg is a number. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defn f4 ((rarg :rest
                  :validate (lambda (x)
                              (-all-p 'identity (mapcar 'numberp x)))))
    "multiply all the arguments."
    (apply '* rarg))

  (f4 1 2 3)
  (condition-case err
      (f4 "oak" 4)
    (error
     (error-message-string err)))
  (describe-function 'f4)
#+END_SRC

That looks ok too. 

* Summary

The motivation for this was to help me write better code with better documentation. Better code in the sense that it can
provide run-time validation, with better feedback, and automatic documentation, including that there is none if that is the
case. It is basically compatible with the regular defun, but enhances what kind of documentation is possible with less work
on my part. I think it will make it easier to keep documentation in sync, since the argument documentation would be kept
near the argument, and you can build in validation if you want to. 

It is no news to lispers that macros are good for this kind of application.
